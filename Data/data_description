This dataset contains the synergy instances obtained from the AZ-DREAM challenge website (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4231880/wiki/), 
and used as the original dataset in the machine learning performance comparison.

The "track" column is used to mark the training and testing sets in cross-validation and therefore ensure that 
only training-set-related augmented data are used to enlarge the training set in each fold.

"drug1_0" to "drug1_299" is the 300-dimensional embedding for CID_1 in the instance.

"drug2_0" to "drug2_299" is the 300-dimensional embedding for CID_2.

"gex_0" to "gex_299 is the 300-dimensional embedded gene expression of each cell line, used as the cellular features during training.

The 900-dimensional features are used as the input to the machine learning model, and the label of each instance is given by "class" column.

For "SYNERGY_SCORE">=20, the two drugs are considered as synergistic (class 1); 
for "SYNERGY_SCORE"<=-20, the two drugs are considered as antagonistic (class 0).
