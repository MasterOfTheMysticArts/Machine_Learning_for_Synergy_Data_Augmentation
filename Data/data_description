## original_synergy_data.tgz
original_synergy_data.tgz is the compressed file for original_synergy_data.csv due to github size limit.
It contains the synergy instances obtained from the AZ-DREAM challenge website (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4231880/wiki/), 
and used as the original dataset in the machine learning performance comparison.

The "track" column is used to mark the training and testing sets in cross-validation and therefore ensure that 
only training-set-related augmented data are used to enlarge the training set in each fold.

"drug1_0" to "drug1_299" is the 300-dimensional embedding for CID_1 in the instance.

"drug2_0" to "drug2_299" is the 300-dimensional embedding for CID_2.

"gex_0" to "gex_299 is the 300-dimensional embedded gene expression of each cell line, used as the cellular features during training.

The 900-dimensional features are used as the input to the machine learning model, and the label of each instance is given by "class" column.

For "SYNERGY_SCORE">=20, the two drugs are considered as synergistic (class 1); 
for "SYNERGY_SCORE"<=-20, the two drugs are considered as antagonistic (class 0).

## Data in the folders
Data in the folders contain the augmented data that were used to generate the results.
As running 2.3 million instances all togetgher takes too long time and too much memory, we did a random sample from the augmented data.
The augmentation instances included here were used to produce results in the paper.
