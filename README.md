# Synergy-Data-Augmentation
This repo tests the augmented synergy data with random forest and gradient boosting trees (GBT). 
These two models are trained against both the original synergy data from AZ-DREAM challenge and
the augmented synergy data. The performance of the models on different datasets is compared to investigate the ability of the augmented data in improving the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.
